# Mechanics
- metanarrative progression
  - failure still leads to progression
  - negative feedback loop on difficulty
  - gain power XP by playing the game
  - power XP upgrades improve power in interesting but straightforward ways
  - after playing a stage, bonus XP granted to a random completed map at random, based on performance
    - encourages variation
    - creates player prompts
    - good hook 
    - random by stage, not by variant
	- persists indefinitely
  - gain vanity XP based on single best performance on each map variant
  - vanity XP can be spent to target or get refreshing rerolls within-stage upgrades
  - unlock more towers and dynamic upgrades at the same time as unlocking maps
- within-stage dynamic specialization of player power
  - choose upgrades for towers etc
  - upgrades cause noticeable specialization
  - randomly available each run
  - (anti- save scumming mechanics)
- map variations using randomizer elements
  - modifies game rules or enemies
  - pushes dynamic exploration
  - (difficulty signaling)
  - (Kaizo variants: only unlocked when you achieve enough summed XP across other variants)
- infinite waves, with convex-up difficulty scaling
  - nominal stage end
  - diminishing returns after nominal end: stop gaining power XP
- level design matters
  - vantages
  - multiple paths
  - diverse enemy goals
- diverse enemy movement patterns
- diverse enemy tactics
  - use agent-based flocking AI
  - hit-and-run, tower destruction
- diverse player tools
  - towers
  - traps
  - melee towers
  - auras
  - unit spawners
  - (pheromones)
- emphasis on tower interactions
  - lean into emergent simulationism ala Noita
- sell for complete value, but use rolling respec instead to limit changes
- tower destruction
  - towers can be damaged but heal fully between waves
  - towers that are destroyed are incapacitated for one wave
  - allow for limited number of resets (per wave) to beginning of last wave

## Open Questions
- enemy objectives?
- how do we accomplish softer / smoother feedback on player success?
  - lives suck
  - losing resources is worse
- mazing or not?

# Thematics
- (copying defeated enemies)

## Open Questions
- core themes?

# Anti-mechanics
- mandatory real-time mechanics
- investment mechanics
  - passive gold income
  - more risk to more in game reward
- limited build time

# Anti-thematics
- gore
- really annoying sounds
