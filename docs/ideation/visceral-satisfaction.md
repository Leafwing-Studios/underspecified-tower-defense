# Visceral Satisfaction

- It's about:
  - Feeling like your actions have a meaningful effect
  - Sfx and visuals play a big part here
- Needs:
  - Clarity in what's going on
    - Few towers
    - Clusters of towers spread out physically
      - The optimal cluster size should not be 1 or infinity. Vantages are likely the way to go to prevent this pattern
    - Moderate number of enemies
  - Variance in action and response. This can come from various places:
    - Tower's inherent cycle (plasma rifle from DOOM, slow windups to big hits, etc.)
      - Tower interactions can sometimes hit this
    - Tower positioning/lines (First line of machine gun turrets that are eventually overrun and then a different line takes over)
      - Changes in map/environment are a variant on this
    - Different enemies (at different times) engage different towers in different ways
      - Transforming enemies are a variant on this
