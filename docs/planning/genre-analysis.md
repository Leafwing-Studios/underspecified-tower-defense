## Core Fantasy
- designing a clever contraption

## Issues
- feast-or-famine gameplay 
  - positive feedback loops on success / failure
  - weak information gradient
- limited opportunity for player interactions
  - mitigated by making the contraption more interesting to watch
- randomly dying
  - poor communication of upcoming events 
  - presence of hard counters, leading to extremely high variance in effectiveness (flying waves)
  - forces learning by repeating static levels
- limited skill expression
- stagnant strategies
  - limited options
  - poor balancing
  - no dynamic variation
- poorly optimized performance
- awkward multiplayer integration

## Audience Overlap
